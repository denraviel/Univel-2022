      "The Special Assistant to Oyo Governor on Student Affairs, Victor Olojede, has faulted the University of Ibadan Students’ Union over the open letter written to the Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde.\n",
      "The students’ union had written a letter to Makinde, calling his attention to the insecurity of lives and properties in the Agbowo community, where a larger percentage of students reside.\n",
      "The Students’ Union body had in the letter signed by its President, Adewole Yinka, and General Secretary, Bamidele Paul, asked the governor to apologise to all victims of various attacks and convey emergency meeting with security agencies in Oyo State.\n",
      "The letter was written following a recent spate of robberies and criminalities in off-campus communities largely inhabited by students of the University of Ibadan. \n",
      "But in a statement on Saturday, Olojede complained that the attempt by the student body to portray the State Government as doing nothing on the security issue as presented in the open letter titled ‘Address insecurity now, our students are dying,’ is “uncalled for and unjustifiable”.\n",
      "The statement read in part, “The Office of the Special Assistant to the Oyo State Governor on Students Affairs will like to appreciate the openness of the Students’ Union of the University of Ibadan in making their concerns over the security situation in communities inhabited by some of the University’s students outside the campus.\n",
      "“The Office, however, condemns the tone with which the message was passed across and the circumstances created by the Open Letter titled “ADDRESS INSECURITY NOW, OUR STUDENTS ARE DYING” and addressed to His Excellency, as they did not present the true picture of things regarding efforts already taken by the State Government.\n",

In fact, many efforts have been made towards tackling these issues, which the UI Students Union is aware of. The Oyo State Government deployed many security operatives to the concerned areas on different occasions.\n",
      "“Equally, as a way of finding a lasting solution to the security issue, on Tuesday, 11th of January 2022, the Office of the S.A. Students Affairs had a security emergency meeting with the leadership of the Students’ Union alongside that of NANS OYO JCC. Different resolutions were made and it was resolved that certain individuals, including all security stakeholders be invited to a meeting as soon as possible. As such, actions were put in motion to make sure that these meetings take place as soon as possible.

      "“The Office is quite disappointed that these various signs of progress and actions of the government to provide long-lasting security assurance in these communities were not mentioned in the open letter.\n",
      "“It is quite unfortunate that only three days after the Government engaged the Students’ Union body, the same body published an open letter in which it cast aspersions on efforts of the Governor and painted the government in bad light, as if nothing is being done regarding the security challenge.\n",
      "“However, in response to the issues raised by the students, the Executive Assistant to the Governor on Security, the Special Assistant to the Governor on Students Affairs, the Chief Security Officer of the University of Ibadan and the Students Union Executives of the University had an emergency meeting on Friday, 14 January 2022. At that meeting, different resolutions were reached and actions have commenced immediately.\n",
      "“It is important to note that the Governor Seyi Makinde-led administration is deeply committed to ensuring the security of lives and property of all residents of Oyo State and it will never take any issue regarding security with levity. Therefore, no stone is being left unturned towards ensuring that security is assured in the affected areas.\n",
      "“Also, the Governor and the Office of the S.A Students’ Affairs are always open to productive and progressive conversation with students, but this should be done through refined and unaggressive approaches.”\n",

      "A senior police officer confirmed to our correspondent that the men, who were earlier believed to have been abducted by the insurgents, found their way to the camp on Saturday.\n",
      "The insurgents had launched a ferocious attack on the police college on Thursday, with many Rocket-Propelled Guns for almost two hours before they overwhelmed the beleaguered policemen inside the school.\n",

      "The officer added, “If there was coordination among the forces, reinforcements can get to the training school within five minutes because there is an army checkpoint around that place. You know it is between Madagali and Gwoza, that place is the border between Adamawa and Borno but it is under Borno. So, there is a checkpoint close to the place.

      "Following the gradual return of peace to parts of Borno State after over a decade of insurgency, the state government has embarked on a massive irrigation farming to boost agricultural activities across 25 local government areas of the state.\n",
      "The State Governor, Prof Babagana Zulum, during an inspection tour of a 35-hectare irrigation farm on Friday in Mafa town of Mafa Local Government Area, described the irrigation farm as a pilot scheme project aimed at returning the state to its pre-insurgency agrarian status.\n",
      "Zulum stated that the government would take advantage of the arable land in the state which, over the years, had been underutilised to engage farmers and returning IDPs in order to provide food security and also improve their socio-economic status.\n",
      "He said the aged, youths, women and young girls would be engaged in agricultural chain productions as it was the only way to address rural urban migration and also encourage villagers to return to their communities. \n",
      "“Borno State has vast arable land and 70 per cent of Borno land has never been cultivated while the remaining 30 per cent is underutilised due largely to activities of insurgents over the years.\n",
      "“We, as a government are looking at how to engage the rural dwellers in meaningful ventures that will address the challenges of unemployment, food provision and security and self-dependency as they return to their communities after years in IDP camps.\n",
      "“This is one of the reasons we stopped donors from distributing foodstuffs to returning communities,” the governor said.\n",

      "He said the irrigation farming would be a major priority of his administration in which government would invest huge amounts of money in farming activities across all the LGAs inline with the predominant agricultural activities of the area starting with the Mafa project.

      "“In Mafa, we have examined our ongoing establishment of irrigation scheme. We have started the pilot scheme. So far, the pilot scheme is good but we also want to plant grasses so that we want to provide ranching in many communities of Borno State. This is a pilot scheme and after the success of this, many more irrigation schemes will be established in Borno State so that we will be able to provide crops and grasses for our animals consumption.\n",
      "“Here on this farm, as you can see, we have planted rice, onions, tomatoes and cucumbers. The idea is to see which produce grows best in particular LGAs so that we can go ahead and invest our resources in such produce. Government does not have enough resources to waste on projects that will not yield the desired dividends. That is why we want to study the system very well to know what we can do at specific locations.\n",
      "“We have already provided land for Ruga in two local government areas.  Therefore, we have to provide grasses for the animals that will be reared in those settlements and other farmers that are engaged in animal husbandry in order to avoid clashes,” the governor stated.\n",
      "Zulum said he had already instructed the Ministry of Agriculture to work with other agencies and institutions to provide seedlings and farming equipment for all the farmers willing to go into dry season farming to motivate them.\n",

      "Striking workers of the Plateau State University, under the auspices of the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities, have vowed to continue with their industrial action and accused Governor Simon Lalong of not showing good example about governance to other northern state governors.\n",
      "The workers, who have been on strike since December last year, made the declaration in a statement made available to Saturday PUNCH in Jos on Friday after their meeting to appraise the industrial action.\n",
      "The statement, which was jointly signed by the Chairman of the union, Timnan Rindap, and Secretary, Fom Dakwak, said it was unfortunate that since the strike started, the Lalong administration, which prides itself as workers’ friendly, had not deemed it fit to engage the workers on how to resolve the industrial dispute at the institution.\n",
      "In explaining the genesis of the strike, the statement recalled that upon the agitation of trade unions in the university in 2017 and 2018, the Prof Attahiru Jega-led Governing Council constituted a committee on staff allowances with the mandate of determining the rates at which the different earned allowances should be paid to the staff of the institution. \n",
      "The statement read in part, “The committee, after consulting resource persons outside the university and meeting with trade unions in the university, concluded its assignment and submitted its report in November 2018. In its report, the committee did not only propose rates for the different earned allowances in the PLASU Regulations, but also submitted financial claims from all staff members of the university based on the proposed rates.\n",
      "“The Governing Council, on November 14, 2018, approved both the rates and the total financial implication for paying the earned allowances. Thereafter, the total financial implication was also approved by the state House of Assembly as part of the 2019 budget and subsequent ones.\n",
      "“Having painstakingly followed all due process and secured all the necessary approvals for the payment of its own share of the earned allowances, SSANU made numerous demands on the Lalong administration to release its own share, which amounted to a total of N310m for the period 2010 to 2020.\n",

      "“It is disheartening to note, however, that from 2019 to date, the Lalong administration, which prides itself as a labour-friendly government, has not released a single kobo for the payment of the arrears of earned allowances to the PLASU senior staff.”\n",
      "The statement, which expressed disappointment at the attitude of the government towards the workers, added, “We wish to call upon well-meaning people of Plateau State and members of the Northern Governors Forum (of which our governor is chair) to prevail on Governor Lalong to redeem his good name and to set a good example for members of the Northern Governors Forum by paying our hard-earned arrears of earned allowances, just as many of his counterparts have done.

      "“We wish to state clearly that as long as our legitimate and hard-earned allowances are not paid, our indefinite strike action, which commenced on December 21, 2021, will not be suspended.”\n",
      "When contacted on the matter, the state Commissioner for Information and Communications, Dan Manjang, referred our correspondent to the Head of Service, Sunday Hyat, whose office he said was responsible for handling the industrial dispute.\n",
      "However, several calls put across to the HoS were unanswered.\n",
      "Also, a text message sent to his mobile telephone on what his office was doing to resolve the industrial action which had yet to be answered as of the time of filing this report.\n",

      "The Federal Government has shelved plans to force international social network services and digital platforms to register and open offices in Nigeria, Saturday PUNCH has learnt.\n",
      "The government’s move to ensure that all over-the-top media services register with the National Broadcasting Corporation has also hit a brick wall as the NBC has failed to roll out the modalities for the registration six months after it published an advertorial asking all online platforms to do so.\n",
      "The Nigerian government had in June last year suspended Twitter barely days after the platform deleted a tweet by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.).\n",
      "The Federal Government subsequently stated that Twitter and all other over-the-top media services must register and pay tax in Nigeria and register with the NBC. \n",
      "The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, had said, “What we are saying is that all platforms must register in Nigeria. You must be a corporate entity before you can do business in Nigeria.\n",
      "“Whether it is Netflix, Iroko, or Facebook…they are all doing business in Nigeria, making money and they are not paying taxes. This is in addition to being able to regulate them. They are making billions of naira out of this country and they are not paying tax. That can’t be allowed to go on.”\n",
      "Subsequently in June, the NBC asked all social media platforms and online broadcasting service providers operating in Nigeria to apply for a broadcast licence.\n",

      "The commission said in an advertorial that the NBC establishment code empowers the commission to ask the companies to be licensed.\n",
      "But Saturday PUNCH learnt that the NBC had no framework for licensing social media platforms.\n",
      "The Chief Executive Officer at IPI Group Limited, Adamu Garba, who is also the co-founder of social media platform, Crowwe, said several attempts made by his firm to register with the NBC proved abortive.\n",
      "Garba said after six months of attempting to register his platform with the NBC, officials at the commission finally admitted to him that there was no framework for licensing social media platforms in Nigeria.\n",
      "He said, “Frankly, there is a problem because there is no framework to register social media based on what I saw. It is a challenge because we went to all the departments in the NBC. None of them was doing anything at all. Eventually, they confessed that this is the situation at hand and that they don’t have that kind of framework where we can register as social media operators.”\n",
      "A top official at the NBC told our correspondent that the Twitter suspension was a knee-jerk reaction and the government didn’t know how to go about the lifting of the suspension, hence it had to introduce some policies.\n",
      "The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, “The NBC has no power or infrastructure in place to license or regulate social media except the Act establishing the commission is amended.\n",

      "The spokesman for the NBC, Ekanem Antia, did not respond to calls on Friday.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Saturday PUNCH also learnt that other foreign social media and digital platforms were no longer under compulsion to open offices in Nigeria.\n",
      "Instead, the government decided in the Finance Act 2021 to mandate all digital platforms to levy a 7.5 per cent Value Added Tax on all advertisers and remit it to the Federal Government.\n",
      "The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, revealed on NTA’s Good Morning Nigeria recently that platforms like Twitter, Amazon and Facebook did not need to open an office in Nigeria.

      "Ahmed said, “Even the international companies that are operating and providing digital services in Nigeria; all the Amazon, the Facebook and the Twitter of this world, operate and have a very large customer base in Nigeria but we don’t get any revenue from them.\n",
      "“So, the Finance Act 2021 that was just signed has made some additional changes. In the 2020 Finance Act, we made provisions to tax the digital economy but we found we could not implement that provision so we had to reinforce that provision in the current Finance Act that will enable us to have those companies provide VAT for services they provide to Nigeria so that the customers they are serving pay this consumption tax and then they remit to us.\n",

      "The Federal Government on Thursday lifted the seven-month ban on Twitter, stating that the social media company is expected to open an office in Nigeria and pay tax before the end of March.\n",
      "Meanwhile the Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives has criticised the Federal Government for saying it had lifted the ban on Twitter in Nigeria, saying it had always considered suspension of the micro-blogging site as illegal.\n",
      "The caucus, in a statement issued by the Minority Leader of the House, Ndudi Elumelu, recalled how it declared the ban as illegal and asked Nigerians to continue to use Twitter.\n",
      "The statement was titled ‘Twitter Ban Lift: FG Has No Right to Regulate Freedom of Opinion – Minority Reps.’\n",
      "The statement read in part, “The Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives describes the ‘declaration’ by the All Progressives Congress-led Federal Government of having lifted its unconstitutional ban on use of Twitter in Nigeria as further demonstration of its appetite to suppress constitutionally guaranteed rights of citizens in Nigeria.”\n",

      "National Secretary of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, John Akpanudoedehe, disclosed this on Friday in a statement titled ‘APC hails President Buhari, Nigerians for standing against Twitter interference’.\n",
      "He said, “The APC salutes President Buhari and the patriotic citizens of our nation for standing firm against the interference of Twitter Inc. in Nigeria’s internal and national security affairs.\n",
      " “We also applaud Twitter for allowing good reason and common interest prevail by agreeing to open their office in Nigeria. This is a win-win for all parties and will create jobs and gainful opportunities for Nigerians in the global digital space.\n",

      "“Following this development, the local vigilantes mobilised to go and flush them out of the forest, but unfortunately, the informants of the terrorists alerted them and they quickly mobilised and ambushed the vigilantes, killing no fewer than 40 of them,” Nasiru revealed.\n",
      "Another resident added that a gun battle between the terrorists and the vigilantes forced residents of Karal, Badija and Karbawi to flee the area to Mutum-Biyu for safety.\n",

If the government had supported our efforts and attached 10 policemen and soldiers to be with the vigilantes on the patrol to flush out criminals, the casualties would not have been that much,” he said.\n",
      "“We want to call on the Federal Government to help us. These terrorists from Zamfara are now in Taraba State. They fought people in the Kanan and Wase areas of Plateau and have now crossed to Taraba.\n",
      "“We are appealing to the Federal Government because the Fulani are at the receiving end of these criminal activities. Daily, our people are selling their cows and paying N20m, N25m as ransom in the bush. Even the people living in town are not spared.\n",
      "“These terrorists are mounting roadblocks and are kidnapping people for ransom. We are appealing to the Federal Government to assist security agencies and vigilantes to flush out these terrorists. We will not allow Taraba to be like Katsina, Zamfara, Sokoto, Kebbi and Niger,” Danburam added.\n",

      "Details have begun to emerge on how over 40 vigilantes were killed and dozens injured in an encounter with terrorists at  Karal forest in Gassol Local Government Area of Taraba State last Tuesday.\n",
      "A local resident, Mallam Nasiru Umar Gassol told our correspondent that the terrorists have been camping in the forest for the past months, but only started kidnapping people a few weeks ago.\n",
      "“We are aware of their presence in the forest and I want to believe security agencies too are aware of their camp in the area.\n",
      "“Just recently, they kidnapped two Fulanis; one from Maraban Gassol, the other from Tella, and a huge amount of money was paid to them as ransom before they were released. \n",
      "“Following this development, the local vigilantes mobilised to flush them out of the forest, but unfortunately, the informants of the terrorists alerted them and they quickly mobilised and ambushed the vigilantes, killing no fewer than 40 of them,” Nasiru said.\n",
      "Another resident added that gun battle between the terrorists and the vigilantes forced residents of Karal, Badija and Karbawi to flee the area to Mutum-Biyu for safety.\n",

      "He said, “The actual number of victims is yet to be ascertained as many people are still missing. The mission of the Fulani Vigilantes and Pulako was to flush out the criminals from their hideout in the Karal forest. They have succeeded in flushing criminals in two camps in Bali Local Government Area and they were on a similar mission to flush out those terrorists in Gassol.\n",
      "“We blame this unfortunate incident on the lack of support from the state government.

      "The Pension Transitional Arraignment Directorate on Friday said that it was working to provide Health Insurance for senior citizens.\n",
      "The Executive Secretary of PTAD, Chioma Ejikeme, during a two-day Pensioners Stakeholders Engagement Forum held in Enugu which also featured the official unveiling of ‘I Am Alive’ confirmation pilot test of Pensioners under the Defined Benefits Scheme in the South East.\n",
      "Ejikeme said to ensure that senior citizens were included in the national health insurance scheme, the Federal Ministry of Health had established a Ministerial Committee to look into the issue, adding that they prioritise the health of the senior citizens and indeed all the pensioners.\n",
      "She said that PTAD and representatives of the Nigerian Union of Pensioners were members of the Committee.  \n",
      "However, performing the official launch of the ‘I Am Alive’ Confirmation pilot test, the Executive Secretary said that when the platform became fully operational, the era of bringing out pensioners for field verification would be over.\n",
      "Ejikeme said that PTAD adopted this technology because there was no way to know that a Pensioner had died except if the pension union reported to them which in most cases takes several months.\n",
      "She said, “The Federal Government is currently paying over N91 billion annually, I am not talking about arrears I am talking of monthly pension because our monthly pension now is over N9billion. When you now add arrears, gratuities that we pay is a humongous amount.”\n",

      "On how the platform work, she explained that the ‘I Am Alive’ confirmation test was an online application to confirm that pensioners on its monthly pension payroll were alive and should continue to receive their pension\n",
      "She explained, “This is a web-based platform designed to enable our pensioners to easily confirm their aliveness from the comfort of their homes or neighbourhood using either a smartphone or a computer system.

      "This solution takes the Pensioner through a three-step confirmation process that ends with a text message response.\n",
      "“The Directorate has decided to deploy the application in phases, starting with fifty thousand pensioners cut across the four operational departments and the six geo-political zones, selected to participate in this pilot phase. On the successful implementation of this pilot phase, we will deploy the application on a full scale at predetermined intervals on a continuous basis for all verified Pensioners on the payroll.\n",
      "“We will conduct the exercise here on all of you as you have been informed, so you can see and understand how it works. Other Pensioners who are part of this pilot phase have equally been notified by PTAD via SMS.”\n",
      "She added, “We are consequently in collaboration with some of our stakeholders including the National Health Insurance Scheme, the National Senior Citizens Centre, and Federal Ministry of Health, to see how making health insurance available to our Pensioners can be a reality.\n",
      "“We will continue to prioritise the welfare of our Pensioners and we call on all the Pension Unions under the Defined Benefit Scheme, and other stakeholders for their support in achieving this feat.”\n",

      "Cities across China are becoming more vigilant against COVID-19 ahead of the Lunar New Year travel season later this month and as Beijing readies to stage the Winter Olympics beginning Feb. 4, with many local governments urging residents not to leave town unnecessarily.\n",
      "Shanghai’s tourism and culture authority said travel agencies and online tourism companies must once again halt organising group tours into and out of Shanghai after it reported five new domestically transmitted infections on Thursday, all linked to an arrival from overseas.\n",
      "The order, in line with a national guideline to cut tourist activities in provinces where new infections have emerged, came less than a month after Shanghai lifted a suspension that had come into effect in November. \n",
      "China has dramatically cut back on international arrivals during the pandemic, but the number of infected travellers arriving in Shanghai, a major financial hub, during the first 10 days of January, exceeded those for all of December.

      "The striking workers at the Plateau State University under the aegis of Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Univetsities have reiterated their position to continue with the industrial action.\n",
      "They said that the state Governor, Simon Lalong, is not showing good example on governance to northern governors.\n",
      "The workers who have been on strike since December last year made the declaration in a statement made available to The PUNCH in Jos on Friday after their meeting.\n",
      "The statement which was jointly signed by the Chairman of the union, Timnan Rindap, and the Secretary, Fom Dakwak, said it was unfortunate that since the strike started, the Lalong-led administration which prides itself as “workers friendly” had not deemed it fit to engage the workers on how to resolve the industrial dispute at the University. \n",
      "In explaining the genesis of the strike,the statement recalled that upon the agitation of trade unions in Plateau State University in 2017 and 2018, the Professor Attahiru Jega-led Governing Council constituted a Committee on Staff Allowances with the mandate of determining the rates at which the different Earned Allowances should be paid to staff of the University.\n",
      "The statement read, “The Committee, after widely consulting resource persons outside the University and meeting with trade unions in the University, concluded its assignment and submitted its report in November, 2018. In its report, the Committee did not only propose rates for the different Earned Allowances in the PLASU Regulations but also submitted financial claims from all staff of the University based on these proposed rates.

      "“Governing Council, on 14th November, 2018, approved both the rates and the total financial implication for paying the Earned Allowances. Thereafter, the total financial implication was also approved by the State House of Assembly as part of the 2019 budget and subsequent ones.\n",

      "“It is disheartening to note, however, that from 2019 to date, the Lalong administration which prides itself as a labour friendly government has not released a single kobo for the payment of the arrears of Earned Allowances to PLASU senior staff.”\n",

      "Poet laureate, Prof Niyi Osundare, has said the more college degrees Nigerians acquire; the farther they tend to be from rational, independent thinking, critical cogitation, clarity of thought, and creative scepticism.\n",
      "He noted that it was the reason the country had “leaders who are busy looking for 19th-century cattle grazing routes at a time their counterparts in saner climes are set on the routes to Mars and Saturn.’’\n",
      "The don said this in a statement sent via email to our correspondent on Friday titled, “Nigeria’s holy romance with ignorance.’’\n",
      "Osundare said, “I have been both saddened and bewildered by the way our people so characteristically throw science and rationality out of the window in their daily lives as well as their deliberations on matters of grave national importance. \n",
      "“In all things, domestic and public, personal and political, our dealings are dominated by a disregard for scientific reasoning, and a preference for ostentatious, and often venal religiosity. And how truly ubiquitous our piety has been!\n",
      "“Our rulers pray before they pillage the nation’s treasury; they pray before rigging the electoral polls; they pray while perpetrating these acts; they pray when the deeds are done. Then they ‘give thanks to the Lord’ for aiding their exploits and prospering their schemes. And we, the people, chorus a sheepish ‘Amen’ while praying to the Good Lord to keep blessing them with renewed strength.\n",
      "“Do you still wonder why the vehicle of Nigeria’s progress is in reverse gear, throttled, top-speed, towards the Middle Ages by ‘leaders’ who prey while the people pray; leaders whose grand superstition has become the alternative science of a country famous for its aversion to logic?’’\n",

      "“Nigeria’s underdevelopment is no surprise, for we do not seem to possess the mindset, vision, values, behaviour, actions, and practices of a people who understand what development really is, the way it is achieved, and how it is sustained.\n",
      "“It should have been clear to us by now that miracles never build a nation nor are citizens ever elevated above their dehumanising poverty through a mindless reliance on magic and accidental fiat,’’ Osundare noted.\n",

# in oop(object oriented programming) we look at everything as an object
## oop concepts
#1. classes - Blue print of the object....A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
## when naming class the first letters are capital letters
#2. objects-Manefestation of a class
#3. instance
# 4. method- A method is a procedure that represent behaviours of a class and is associated with the objects of that class




#5. attributes-characteristics
#6. inheritance
#7. polymorphism
#8. Abstraction

#Attribute are divide into class attributes and Instance attributes
##Class Attributes: Are attributes that are the same accross board
##Instance Attributes : They are unique attributes to an object

#Print vs. return in Python

##Printing and returning are completely different concepts.

###print is a function you call. Calling print will immediately make your program write out text for you to see. Use print when you want to show a value to a human.

####return is a keyword. When a return statement is reached, Python will stop the execution of the current function, sending a value out to where the function was called. Use return when you want to send a value from one point in your code to another.

#####Using return changes the flow of the program. Using print does not.



##save data into a variable which you can use later while print you cant use the value later

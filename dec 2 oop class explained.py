# in oop(object oriented programming) we look at everything as an object
## oop concepts
#1. classes - Blue print of the object....A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
## when naming class the first letters are capital letters
#2. objects-Manefestation of a class
#3. instance
# 4. method- A method is a procedure that represent behaviours of a class and is associated with the objects of that class
    #instace method _init_ is an instance method not a class method.To initialize instance attributes...there are two types of instance method the accessor(access instance method) and the mutator instance method() 
    #class method for class method you use cls
    #static method- no connection with instance or class. it is just a regular function 



#5. attributes-characteristics
##6. inheritance
#7. polymorphism
#8. Abstraction
## encapcelnation   

#Attribute are divide into class attributes and Instance attributes
##Class Attributes: Are attributes that are the same accross board.It is available to the whole class
##Instance Attributes : They are unique attributes to an object

#Print vs. return in Python

##Printing and returning are completely different concepts.

###print is a function you call. Calling print will immediately make your program write out text for you to see. Use print when you want to show a value to a human.

####return is a keyword. When a return statement is reached, Python will stop the execution of the current function, sending a value out to where the function was called. Use return when you want to send a value from one point in your code to another.

#####Using return changes the flow of the program. Using print does not.



##save data into a variable which you can use later while print you cant use the value later


## Inheritance - Making use of an item not urs but u can have access to it
# you create inheritance relationship between classe wenever u need certain methods that have been defined in a pre-existing class
# under inheritance there is the parent class and child class
#write a class that takes in users personal info and write it into csv file
#name, gender age and loaction if the user can supply the name and age then the user should be able to change location


#multi particular class independently inheriting from another class simulatneously
